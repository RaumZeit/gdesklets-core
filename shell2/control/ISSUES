Some issues that should perhaps be addressed
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
» currently availability of metadata between the local
  and remote widgets differs quite greatly. For example 
  there is no description or authors available to the 
  local controls (no <meta> element, or something similar)
  
    » partial fix for desklets: the descriptions, authors and
      version will be extracted from a supplied display file
      when the user submits a desklet. This makes the local
      and remote metadata match.
      
    » long term fix: create a local file database that can
      store the values from the remote site. This would store
      the control descriptions and other things and would make 
      it unnecessary to parse display files for metadata, etc.
