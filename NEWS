  <html> element which was never used anyway, and wasn't portable at all
- No longer depends on GConf (yes, your old config of the desklets will get
  lost, sorry about that)
- Lots of code cleanups leading to better performance
- In general, more robust

New in release 0.34:
- New controls shipped with the core (ArrayBuffer, EventPipe)

  X server DPI value now

- NOTE: The old way of computing interface IDs had a bug, so that interfaces get
        a different interface ID now. gDesklets can still handle the old buggy
        IDs, but IDs generated by this version won't work with older releases of
        gDesklets. It is thus highly recommended to upgrade to 0.34!
